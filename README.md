## Installation and Use

### Apple MacOS and Linux

Copy the contents of the .bashrc file to your personal .bashrc file.
This file supports Bash for both MacOS and Linux in the same script, but you can copy out just the aliases for your specific operating system if you choose.

From the command line use ***dropboxignore <path>*** to add an absolute path (directory or file) that should not be synced.
Use ***dropboxsync <path>*** with an absolute path to "un-ignore" it and resume syncing.

### Microsoft Windows

Copy the contents of the profile.ps1 file to your PowerShell profile.
You can check to see if you have a powershell profile set with ***$profile*** at the PowerShell command line.
If that returns false (there isn't a PowerShell profile), create a new one with ***New-Item -path $profile -type file -force***.

From the PowerShell command line use ***dropboxignore <path>*** to add an absolute path (directory or file) that should not be synced.
Use ***dropboxsync <path>*** with an absolute path to "un-ignore" it and resume syncing.
